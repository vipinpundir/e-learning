}
Save the file and then start the JSON Server with the following command:

json-server --watch db.json

Now you're all set! The website should be up and running at http://localhost:3000.

Users
The E-Learning website allows users to access courses based on their roles. There are two user roles available:

Admin User

Name: Vipin Pundir
Email: vipin1@gmail.com
Password: 1234
Role: admin
Normal User

Name: Vipin
Email: vipin2@gmail.com
Password: 1234
Role: normal
As an admin user, you have full access to the website, including the ability to add, edit, or delete courses. Normal users can browse the courses and watch their videos but do not have permission to modify course data.

Feel free to explore the E-Learning website and enhance your programming skills with our diverse range of courses!

Note: Please make sure you have the db.json server running to see the course data and user information on the website.

Thank you for using our E-Learning platform! Happy learning! ðŸš€
